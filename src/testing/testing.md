# Testing CADS

Instead of writing various test functions in the main file itself that can be 
invoked by uncommenting them. Although a sound approach, but ugly as hell. So,
a wrapper called [Testing](../testing.h) is provided that just reduces unit testing
interface to just two lines and it can be customized during initialization for
the required data type one needs to test. Resulting in cleaner code, usage and
execution.

Well that's the plan. This document is incomplete and will be updated accordingly
as the development proceeds.

## Modules
