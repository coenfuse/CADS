# CADS (v 0.1.1.17)
##### Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
---

CADS is a simple, learner friendly and fully customizable, Data Structure and Algorithm library for C++ developers. A lightweight C++ library using simplest of the coding practices to maintain highest levels of readability.

- **Modular :** Remove the stuff you don't need.
- **Simple :** Easier to understand and modify
- **Tested :** Run existing tests or make your own.

## Features

- Heavily documented, Explaining the smallest of its features and nuances in great detail.
- Using common English words and method names to improve read-ability.
- Healthy balance of inheritance and code duplication to provide most optimum performance.
- Bundled with a complete testing system so user can test the performance of library and fidelity of its claims.
- No performance drop as compared to the STL.
- Appropriate for both novices and seasoned developers of any programming language.

## Containers
- [**Array**](src/cads/array.h) : Read documentation [here](doc/array.md)

## How to Use

In it's nascent state, CADS currently doesn't have any proprietary installer with it. One can just download the `/src` folder from the repo and add into their project.

## Development

This project is in its very early stage of development and currently consists of only a few data structures. The development is prioritized to create a strong structure consisting of very simple functionalities. Other performance upgrades and new features are slated for future releases.
The development roadmap can be found [**_here_**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Ft03dRXFYWrKtom0DVzPqHSylF1ATiC/view?usp=sharing)

## Testing CADS
A proprietary testing wrapper has been defined in the CADS project that handles everything related to testing.
Kindly read the [testing](...) documentation **( _incomplete_ )** for more information.

## Dependencies

CADS currently uses a few core C++ functions. Later on it will be completely detached from any dependency. Making it a completely independent library working out of the box. See the [development roadmap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Ft03dRXFYWrKtom0DVzPqHSylF1ATiC/view?usp=sharing) for more details.
