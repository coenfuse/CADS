# CADS

CADS is an attempt to create a better STL for C++ developers and learners.
Implemented in simple readable syntax, CDS tries to overcome the few drawbacks in STL (one being highly unreadable).
This project is in its very early stage of development and currently consists of only a few data structures.
While the current priority is to write simple code, performance upgrades will be implemented in parallel as the development progresses.

## How is this project structured?
This project is divided into two namespaces:
- **Learn :** All the code coming under this category is aimed towards learning purposes only and not meant to be incorporated in serious projects.
Thouroughly commented to explain the logic with complete documentation at the end of each file.
*Note: Some of the code is really stupid here, Users are recommended to learn from it and improve it as a practice howsover they like.*

- **CADS :** Improving from the **Learn**, all the code residing in this category is geared towards performance. Since high degree of readability is
still being maintained in this section a user is recommeded to tailor the code as required. Although there has been an attempt to made this code as generic
as possible while trying not to overstuff trivial features.

## Development
Currently the author is having a good time messing up with iterators and sorting algorithms.
Since this is a very early version of the project, this documentation is subject to frequent changes.

## Usage
This project is uploaded as a MSVC project (project file included).
Test cases and all the unit test code is included in the [main.cpp]() file. Each test can be initiated by uncommenting its section.
